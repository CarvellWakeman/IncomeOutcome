# IncomeOutcome
Expense and Income tracking android app.

**Note:** This application was started almost four years ago, and I have not maintained it well due to college.
It was built before I had a good grasp on architecture, GitHub issue tracking, or many of the commonly used tools today (RxJava, Retrofit, Firebase, Dagger2, Room, Butterknife, etc).

As such, it is a little messy and has some anti-patterns.
I have been looking to give it the care it deserves, but haven't had time until I graduated.
