# IncomeOutcome
Expense and Income tracking android app.

**Note:** This application was started almost four years ago, and I have not maintained it well due to college.
It was built before I had a good grasp on architecture, GitHub issue tracking, or many of the commonly used tools today (RxJava, Retrofit, Firebase, Dagger2, Room, Butterknife, etc).

As such, it is a little messy and has some anti-patterns.

I have learned many things and worked on many projects (Android and not) since I started this app.
It needs work, which means I need time, and that's something I haven't had until graduation.
